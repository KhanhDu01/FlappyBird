This is a side project I did during high school. I had just learnt the basics of python and got inspiried by the endless possibilities of coding.
I did some research and found that Pygame is a very useful library for anyone who wanted to code games in Python.
Pygame uses sprites and rectangles. Rectangles to act as collision dectecters while sprites to act as images/visuals for the game
Flappy bird was the second project I worked on. Compared to Pong, I wanted it to be more visual based and mess around more with moving images and doing animations
Although it looks simple, flappy bird was a bit more complicated to work with, mainly dealing with figuring out how to animate the bird,
how to loop through the background infinitely, creating a sense of depth with two different backgrounds, and imitating how the bird in the original game
rotates everytime it flies up.

To run the game yourself, download the zip file and run the Flappy Bird python file in that folder.
