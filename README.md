This is a side project I did during high school. I had just learnt the basics of python and got inspiried by the endless possibilities of coding.
I did some research and found that Pygame is a very useful library for anyone who wanted to code games in Python.
Pygame uses sprites and rectangles. Rectangles to act as collision dectecters while sprites to act as images/visuals for the game

Flappy bird was the second project I worked on. Compared to Pong, I wanted it to be more visual based and mess around more with moving images and doing animations
Although it looks simple, flappy bird was a bit more complicated to work with, mainly dealing with: 
- Animating the bird
- Looping through the background infinitely
- Looping through the pipes infinitely and have them appear in random positions
- Creating a sense of depth with two different backgrounds
- Imitating how the bird in the original game rotates everytime it flies up.

Something I struggles with was figuring out how to put transparent background on each image file and 
how to fix collision between the bird and the pipe (since the rectangle for the bird is bigger than it actually is,
I had to figure out the perfect size the rectangle has to be so that the collision is more realistic).

To run the game yourself, download the zip file and run the Flappy Bird python file in that folder.
